Data from PACE were primarily used:
•	Liquid Water Path
•	Spectral aerosol graphical
•	Cloud top phase
•	Calibrated radiometry and polarimetry
•	HARP2 data
•	Spectral remote sensing reflectance OCI
•	Spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient
These data were used to simulate probable challenges that would be launched for the users of the platform.
